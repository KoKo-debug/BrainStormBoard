# BrainStormBoard

BrainStormBoard is a website that allows members of an organization the ability to map out possible solutions to their unique problems.


## Background and Overview
A group or organization is tackling a tricky problem, and what they really need are FRESH ideas. BrainStormBoard will allow members to annonymously post solutions/ideas to a central problem. 

Each member will also be able to vote on their favorite solution/idea and the group as a whole will be able to easily identify which ideas are most popular based on number of votes (distinguished visually). Members will also be able to ask for clarification/feedback by adding more posts linked to the solution/idea.

posts made to the board can be customized by background-color, font-color, font-style.
